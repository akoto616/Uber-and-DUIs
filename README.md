Uber-and-DUIs
=============
After looking at the data sets and isolating the incidents by year, there appears to be a spike in Kidnappings and Drunkeness around the same time that there was a decrease in DUIs.

If it’s true that the lower rate of DUI’s can be attributed to Uber’s launch, we would also need to see that decrease continue or level out. Instead we see a slight spike. 

Additionally, drunkeness as an offense did increase during that same period, so it is possible that more people took to drinking once Uber made it so that they wouldn't have to drive. But yellow taxis offer the same service. In short, I don't believe there is enough data for Uber to make this claim.
